**Project Description**

**File Storage**

**Approach One**

```
We store the file in the database as a binary file.

In this project i store images as compressed byte file in the DB
This approach is more sucure but is less efficient in terms of speed.

More sucure access and less frquently used image

```
**Approach Two (File Storage)**

```
Store Image in a file sytem and just save the path of where the file is
stored into the DB.

This method provides faster access where the image is used frequenty.
